# basic premise

Your face gets stolen in a cosmetic clinic and you need to find it and escape.

### game loop/logic

you start without face, need to kill guards/nurses to get their faces.
if you have their face you can enter certain places and guards are not hostile.
the attached face starts to melt/deform with time.
the more its deformed the more suspicious/hostile the guards are (their detection cone gets bigger)

at the end you need to steal the face of the main doctor to enter the space where your face is.
When you have your face you need to escape the building but eveybody becomes hostile.
